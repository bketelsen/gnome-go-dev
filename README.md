## To Use the Dev Container

In your project, add devcontainer configuration from the VSCode command menu.

Then edit the configuration to use the image generated by this repo's gh actions.  Here's an example:

```json
{
	"name": "Blincus Dev",
	"image": "ghcr.io/bketelsen/gnome-go-dev:latest",

	"mounts": [
		{
			"source": "/var/lib/incus",
			"target": "/var/lib/incus",
			"type": "bind"
		}
	],
	"remoteUser": "ubuntu"
}
```

Notice how you can skip all the Features? They're built into the base devcontainer.
